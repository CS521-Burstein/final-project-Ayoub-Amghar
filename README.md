Option 1: House Price Predictor.
For the final project we have decided to work on House Price Predictor "Option 1".

First Deliverable: 
Extensions we have discussed to work on:
1. Implement a linear regression class 
2. Compare different regression models
3. Visually and descriptively compare your results to Zillow or other sites.
* We have attached a script to download data-set programatically.

We would like to know if this amount of work would be as what you expecting for 4 members.
