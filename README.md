# Final Project: Data Analysis 

MEMBERS: Ayoub Amghar, Marouan Boussif, and Supawadee Phakdee.


Option 1: House Price Predictor.
For the final project we have decided to work on House Price Predictor "Option 1".

First Deliverable: 
Extensions we have discussed to work on:
1. Implement a linear regression class  
2. Visualize and evaluate the data in correlation
3. Visually and descriptively compare your results to Zillow.
* We have attached a script to download data-set programatically.

Second Deliverable:
We have pushed a jupyter file that has the code to load dataset into dataframe. we used Pandas and explored some its features such us execute SQL queries with our Dataframe to sort and filter data. We also used matplotlib.pyplot to draw a graph to visulize some data we need to analyze for other extentions. Please check jupyter file named 'Data_Analysis'.

Third deliverable:

we worked on Linear regression model, we have compared the year of 2007 and 2008 saleprices. We also worked on correlation. 

Final submission:

- We have worked on Correlation data set, also we have trained and test the data, 
- we have visually & descriptively compared Zillow and our data to predict the market price in the range of 10 years.
-PDF write-up that explains the purpose of this project and all the methods we used to analyze and compare the data.


Have a nice summer break Professor, it was pleasure taking the class with you.
