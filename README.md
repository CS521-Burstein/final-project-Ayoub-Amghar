First Deliverable: 
Extensions we have discussed to work on:

2. Visualize and evaluate the data in correlation
3. Visually and descriptively compare your results to Zillow.
* We have attached a script to download data-set programatically.

Second Deliverable:
We have pushed a jupyter file that has the code to load dataset into dataframe. we used Pandas and explored some its features such us execute SQL queries with our Dataframe to sort and filter data. We also used matplotlib.pyplot to draw a graph to visulize some data we need to analyze for other extentions. Please check jupyter file named 'Data_Analysis'.
